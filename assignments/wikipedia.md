# Contribution to Wikipedia

**INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT**

**Deadline**: October 18

**How to submit**: Document to BBLearn

**Value**: 10%



Each student will be required to make a significant contribution to a Wikipedia article of their choice. This will introduce you to the process of contributing to a crowd-sourced platform. Create an account (in case you do not have one) and go ahead. Fight the good fight.

The deliverable can either be document with a link to the contribution (if accepted) or a brief explanation why the contribution was not accepted by the community. 

As a new contributor, you may feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer size and scope of this project called Wikipedia. Don't worry too much if you don't understand everything at first, as it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Wikipedia not only allows you to create, revise, and edit articles, but it wants you to do so. You just need to remember that you can't break Wikipedia and although there are many protocols, perfection is not required, as Wikipedia is a work in progress. Collaborative editing means that incomplete or poorly written first drafts can evolve over time into excellent articles.
